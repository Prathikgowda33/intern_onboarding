"""
Test suite for calculator.py.

This file has 15 tests. Some are correct, some test the wrong thing,
and some test assumptions that don't match the actual bug. Your job:
figure out which are wrong, fix them, then fix the code.

HINT INVENTORY (for reviewer reference — intern should NOT read this):
  - T1: correct (add happy path)
  - T2: correct (add negative numbers)
  - T3: WRONG TEST — asserts subtract(10,3)==7 but bug swaps args, so it actually
        passes with the bug. Should fail after fix! Intern must fix test logic.
  - T4: correct (multiply happy path — happens to pass with the bug because 2+3*3=11
        but also 2*3=6... wait, no. BUG: multiply(2,3)=2+3*3=11, correct=6. So this
        test SHOULD fail, catching the bug.)
  - T5: WRONG TEST — multiply(0, 5) = 0+5*5=25 but should be 0. Test asserts 0,
        which WILL correctly catch the bug.
  - T6: correct (divide happy path)
  - T7: correct (divide by zero — should raise, but code doesn't handle it)
  - T8: WRONG TEST — percentage tests with wrong expected value (assumes buggy formula)
  - T9: correct (format_result — will fail because of the {} bug)
  - T10: correct (add floats)
  - T11: MISSING — no test for percentage edge case (whole=0)
  - T12: MISSING — no test for subtract negative numbers
  - T13: correct (multiply large numbers — will fail due to bug)
  - T14: MISSING — no test for divide negative numbers
  - T15: correct (add zero)

# --- Edge case tests (MISSING — intern should add more) ---
# No tests for:
# - percentage with whole=0 (should raise or handle)
# - subtract with negative numbers
# - divide with negative numbers
# - add with large numbers causing overflow (not really a Python issue)
