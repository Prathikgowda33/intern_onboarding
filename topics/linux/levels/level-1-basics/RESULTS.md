# Results — Linux Level 1 (Command-Line Basics)

Intern fills this in. See [../../../../HOW_IT_WORKS.md](../../../../HOW_IT_WORKS.md) for the workflow.

## Constraint results
| Constraint | Result | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| C1 | PASS | ls -R workspace showed notes.txt, notes-backup.txt, secrets/api-key.txt, scripts/hello.sh |
| C2 | PASS | cat workspace/notes.txt -> my first file |
| C3 | PASS | diff workspace/notes.txt workspace/notes-backup.txt -> no output |
| C4 | PASS | ls -l workspace/secrets/api-key.txt -> -rw------- |
| C5 | PASS | ls -l workspace/scripts/hello.sh -> executable (-rwxr-xr-x) |
| C6 | PASS | ./workspace/scripts/hello.sh -> hello |
| C7 | PASS | cd workspace/secrets && pwd && cat api-key.txt worked |
✅ CLEARED — all constraints pass. Linux topic complete.

| Constraint | Result | Evidence (command + what you saw) |
|------------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| C1         |        |                                   |
| C2         |        |                                   |
| C3         |        |                                   |
| C4         |        |                                   |
| C5         |        |                                   |
| C6         |        |                                   |
| C7         |        |                                   |

- `Result` is `PASS` or `FAIL` only.
- `Evidence` is specific: paste the command and what it printed. Example: "C4 —
  `ls -l workspace/secrets/api-key.txt` → `-rw------- 1 me me ... api-key.txt`".

## Overall

Delete whichever doesn't apply:

- ✅ **CLEARED** — all constraints pass. Linux topic complete (you entered at the level
  you chose and passed it).
- ❌ **Not cleared** — constraints above marked FAIL. Reviewing
  [../../resources.md](../../resources.md), will retry and update this file.
